<h2>events</h2>

<p>Your event handlers will be passed instances of <code>SyntheticEvent</code>, a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. It has the same interface as the browser's native event, including <code>stopPropagation()</code> and <code>preventDefault()</code>, except the events work identically across all browsers.</p>

<p>If you find that you need the underlying browser event for some reason, simply use the <code>nativeEvent</code> attribute to get it.</p>
