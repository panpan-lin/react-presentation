<h2>Component</h2>

<p>Instances of a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-api.html" target="_blank">React Component</a> are created internally in React when rendering. These instances are reused in subsequent renders, and can be accessed in your component methods as <code>this</code>. The only way to get a handle to a React Component instance outside of React is by storing the return value of <code>ReactDOM.render</code>. Inside other Components, you may use <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html" target="_blank"><code>refs</code></a> to achieve the same result.</p>
